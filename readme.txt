== Description ==

This plugin adds a payment gateway to WooCommerce that allows customers to pay for their order in person with cash or other available payment options when they come to pick up their items in-store. This provides a flexible payment option for customers who prefer to pay in person rather than online.

The plugin comes with several customization options that can be set up in the WooCommerce payment settings. These include:

Payment method title and description
Maximum and minimum payment amounts
Eligible shipping methods
Order processing time
Store address and schedule

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the payment process work? =

When the customer chooses the Collect and Pay in Store payment method during checkout, the order is marked as "on-hold" and the stock levels are reduced. The customer can then pick up their order in person and pay for it using cash or other available payment options. Once the payment is received, the order status is changed to "processing" and the order is completed.

= How do I set up the store address and schedule? =

The store address and schedule can be set up in the payment gateway settings under the "Store Address" and "Store Schedule" sections. You can enter the store address and the days and hours of operation for each day of the week.

= How do I customize the payment method title and description? =

You can customize the payment method title and description in the payment gateway settings under the "Title" and "Description" sections.

= How do I set up the maximum and minimum payment amounts? =

You can set up the maximum and minimum payment amounts in the payment gateway settings under the "Maximum Amount" and "Minimum Amount" sections. You can enter the amount in the currency used on your website.
